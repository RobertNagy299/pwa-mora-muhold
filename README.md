# MoraMuhold - Móra Satellite

Check out the app [here](https://szte-satellite.web.app/home)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.

This project is a part of the Space Program of the University of Szeged, Hungary. At the Móra Ferenc Student Dormitory for Advanced Studies, a few students were working on a satellite in the school year of 2024/25. Our goal was to collect scientific data through various sensors and send them back to Earth for deeper study. This app would visualize the data received from the satellite; however, as of August 2025, the construction of the satellite is still in progress. In the meantime, the data is simulated on the client-side from within the Angular app, making it a proof of concept or simulation instead of a real satellite dashboard.

## What I learned

This project helped me to learn the fundamentals of <b>NGRX and RXJS</b>. (Client-side state management and reactive programming - learning to use Observables and Pipe factories (fluent pattern) instead of Promises and callback-chains)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
